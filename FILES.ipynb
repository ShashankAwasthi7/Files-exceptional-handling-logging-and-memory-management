    "Question1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
    "Answer : Compiled languages are translated into machine code by a compiler before the program is run. This results in a standalone executable file that is fast but specific to a particular platform (e.g., Windows or macOS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: C, C++, Go, Rust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted languages are translated on the fly, line by line, by an interpreter while the program is running. This makes them more portable and easier to test, but generally slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the main difference is when the translation from human-readable code to machine instructions happens: before execution (compiled) or during execution (interpreted).\n"

    "Question 2: What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "Answer:  Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows you to manage and respond to errors (exceptions) that occur during the execution of a program without causing the program to crash. When an error occurs, Python raises an exception. Instead of letting the program terminate abruptly, you can \"catch\" these exceptions and implement code to handle them gracefully, ensuring the program can continue running or exit in a controlled manner. This improves the robustness and reliability of your applications."

    "Question 3: What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
    "Answer:  The finally block in Python's exception handling mechanism is used to define actions that must be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred in the try block or was handled by an except block. This makes it ideal for cleanup operations, such as closing files, releasing system resources, or database connections, ensuring that these critical tasks are always performed, even if an error disrupts the normal flow of the program."

    "Question 4: What is logging in Python?\n",
    "Answer:  Logging in Python is a powerful and flexible way to record events that occur while a program is running. It allows developers to track the flow of execution, debug issues, and monitor the health and performance of an application. Instead of using simple print() statements for debugging (which are often removed in production), logging provides a more structured and configurable approach, allowing messages to be directed to various outputs (console, files, network, etc.) and filtered by severity levels. Python's built-in logging module facilitates this."
